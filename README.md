## Java-Rock-Dodge
This is the dodger game which I made a few years ago running on Greenfoot IDE (3.1.0) during my early days of programming.
This game is actually a graded project which I created for a module in a programming course I took. 

## Objective
- Dodge falling rocks
- Throw axes to chop the logs.
- ???

## Screenshots
(add screenshots here)



TODO List:
- Add sound
- Add end condition
- Implement difficulty levels (maybe if I'm still interested)
